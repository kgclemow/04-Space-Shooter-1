# 04-Space-Shooter

This is a space shooter game, created in Godot, as a requirement for MSCH-C220 at Indiana University using GDScript. The project helps us learn about scenes, basic animatation, scripts, and signaling. While my game does not function properly, I tried my best. 

Control the ship with WASD and shoot with the space bar. The object of the game is to shoot meteors and enemy ships in order to stay alive and rack up a higher score.
